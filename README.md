Alfred2WriteLetter
==================

Alfred2 Workflow to create a LaTeX-Letter-Template prefilled with the address selected

To-Do
-----
* Since Alfred does not provide more than one address-detail, you need to insert the name of whom you want to write, by hand.  
* Also there could be too much line-breaks in address field.
